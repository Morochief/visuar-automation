# Market Intelligence Engine - React Premium Dashboard Boilerplate

This folder tracks the React Components explicitly requested for the Intelligence Dashboard.

## Setup
In your Astro project:
1. `npm install lucide-react`
2. Configure Tailwind CSS with `@tailwindcss/vite` or equivalent plugin to enable native class compilation.
3. Import `Dashboard.tsx` dynamically with React Island logic:
`<Dashboard client:load />`
